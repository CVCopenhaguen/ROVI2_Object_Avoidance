#### ROS shit 
- How to make the robot execute an interpolated trajectory smoothly.
	- How to give the path is solved.
	- Figure out how to specify the passing times to the path (I don't know if it's needed)
- Write a ROS node that does all the path planning.

#### NON-ROS shit
- Upgrade the offline RRT\* to ONLINE path planning
